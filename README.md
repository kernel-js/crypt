## Inspirations

The main inspiration on my work is PHP Laravel Framework which I love because of its simplicity and beauty of code.

## Why

First of all I created this to support development of [Kernel Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kernel-js/framework).<br />
Just like the rest of the packages that make up the framework, I make the most of other existing libraries that are well 
tested on a day-to-day basis. The idea is not to reinvent the wheel, just join the ideas in a lightweight framework 
(the focus is on the client side), simple to use and make the code on the front more beautiful and organized. 

## Install
```npm install @kernel-js/crypt```

## Helpers

### Custom

* [encrypt](#encrypt)
* [decrypt](#decrypt)
* [encryptWithHmac](#encryptWithHmac``)
* [decryptWithHmac](#decryptWithHmac)
* [encryptWithTSValidation](#encryptWithTSValidation)
* [decryptWithTSValidation](#decryptWithTSValidation)

<br />
<a name="encrypt" /></a>

### encrypt

Encrypts a string using aes-256-cbc algorithm.

	encrypt(value, password)

__Arguments__

* `value` - the value to encrypt
* `password` - the password used to encrypt and decrypt (keep it safe)
